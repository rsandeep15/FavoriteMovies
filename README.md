My project for the Udacity FullStack Developers Course: Chapter 1

To run the application, clone this git repo, navigate to the root of this project directory and type on commandline
```
python entertainment_center.py
`````

A web browser will open with a site containing my favorite movies with clickable poster images that play that movie's trailer
on YouTube.
